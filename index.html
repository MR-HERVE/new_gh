        <p>They were set book actors,except Mordecai at the Kenya national theatre.The pay was not as good
            as the opportunity may sound,they were paid sh.300 per performance.This was a tyring experience
            for they travelled from one county to another,often they would sleep on the road.In 2013 they sang 
            a political song during election period.That is when they started to think about the name of the 
            group and later decided on H_art the band.They signed a deal with penya records and were enrolled 
            in Sauti Sol Academy.
